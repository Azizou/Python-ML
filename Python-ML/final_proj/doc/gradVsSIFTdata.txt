1) In SIFT dataset, total number of Caltech 101 images: 8677

2) In Gradients dataset, training images: 4467, validation images: 2406, testing images: 2323. 


So there exists a discrepancy between images in SIFT dataset and images in Gradients dataset, and there's no way we can find which is which.

To experiment with SIFT, we will need to take about 50% of the images. We will do this via bootstrap re-sampling with aim to retrieve 
4367 examples. In the end, we will average our results over all those samples.
