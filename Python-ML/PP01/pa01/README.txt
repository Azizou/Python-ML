Please find the ipython notebook "PA01.ipynb" in the "code" subdirectory. I left it there because I
was stuck with a Windows partition that was giving me trouble with the paths to the source code subdirectory ("code") when importing
modules.

Every piece of code that isn't my own has been explicitly credited either
on the source code or on the ipython notebook, in compliance with the course's academic honesty policy.

Sincerely, Jason
